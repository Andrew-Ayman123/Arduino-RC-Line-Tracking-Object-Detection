## :star2: About The Project
The line follower robot is an automated vehicle that follows a visual line embedded on the surface. Generally, it uses a black line on a white surface, or you can adjust it as a white line on a black surface.

In industries, giant line follower robots are used for assisting the automated production process. They are also used in military applications, human assistance purposes, delivery services, etc.
